# Bash-Scripting
A repo to hold my script for bash scripting
This is the README file that I will be documenting my work with the tutorial that is linked in the project directions. I followed the steps in the tutorial, and
included my backup.sh script in this repo. The current state of this repo is that I have finished coding the backup.sh script with the function backup and included the for loop at the end. The only source I used is the one provided in the project directions is the one linked in the project directions, which is https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners. I should note that on this project, I used an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine as the commands in the tutorial match, and it had the nano text editor built in, which was needed to write the script. I only uploaded the backup.sh script as the code in it applied the code demonstrated in the tutorial scripts.
